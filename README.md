This project is a simple Boids simulation of spheres using this document as a reference: http://www.kfish.org/boids/pseudocode.html

This game includes the following rules:
  -Boids try to fly towards the center of mass of neighboring nodes
  -Boids try to keep a small distance away from other objects and boids
  -Boids try their best to match their velocity with nearby boids.

  Tweaks:
    -Bounding Positions
    -Limiting the speed

To run this project either:
